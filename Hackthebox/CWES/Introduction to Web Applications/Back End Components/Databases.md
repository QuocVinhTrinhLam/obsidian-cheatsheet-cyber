## Relational (SQL)

[Relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) (SQL) databases store their data in tables, rows, and columns. Each table can have unique keys, which can link tables together and create relationships between tables.

For example, we can have a `users` table in a relational database containing columns like `id`, `username`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and so on. The `id` can be used as the table key. Another table, `posts`, may contain posts made by all users, with columns like `id`, `user_id`, `date`, `content`, and so on.

Some of the most common relational databases include:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)|The most commonly used database around the internet. It is an open-source database and can be used completely free of charge|
|[MSSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server)|Microsoft's implementation of a relational database. Widely used with Windows Servers and IIS web servers|
|[Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database)|A very reliable database for big businesses, and is frequently updated with innovative database solutions to make it faster and more reliable. It can be costly, even for big businesses|
|[PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL)|Another free and open-source relational database. It is designed to be easily extensible, enabling adding advanced new features without needing a major change to the initial database design|
## Non-relational (NoSQL)

There are 4 common storage models for `NoSQL` databases:

- Key-Value
- Document-Based
- Wide-Column
- Graph

The above example can be represented using `JSON` as follows:

```json
{
  "100001": {
    "date": "01-01-2021",
    "content": "Welcome to this web application."
  },
  "100002": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "This is the first post on this web app."
  },
  "100003": {
    "date": "02-01-2021",
    "content": "Reminder: Tomorrow is the ..."
  }
}
```

Some of the most common `NoSQL` databases include:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|[MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)|The most common `NoSQL` database. It is free and open-source, uses the `Document-Based` model, and stores data in `JSON` objects|
|[ElasticSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)|Another free and open-source `NoSQL` database. It is optimized for storing and analyzing huge datasets. As its name suggests, searching for data within this database is very fast and efficient|
|[Apache Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra)|Also free and open-source. It is very scalable and is optimized for gracefully handling faulty values|
## Use in Web Applications

For example, within a `PHP` web application, once `MySQL` is up and running, we can connect to the database server with:

```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "pass");
```

Then, we can create a new database with:

```php
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE database1"; 
$conn->query($sql)
```

After that, we can connect to our new database, and start using the `MySQL` database through `MySQL` syntax, right within `PHP`, as follows:

```php
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "pass", "database1");
$query = "select * from table_1";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

Web applications usually use user-input when retrieving data. For example, when a user uses the search function to search for other users, their search input is passed to the web application, which uses the input to search within the database(s).

```php
$searchInput =  $_POST['findUser'];
$query = "select * from users where name like '%$searchInput%'";
$result = $conn->query($query);
```

Finally, the web application sends the result back to the user:

```php
while($row = $result->fetch_assoc() ){ 
	echo $row["name"]."<br>"; 
}
```
